**Rules of the game:**  

The player has a rectangular field with a width of 10 and a height of 25 cells.  
Figures fall from above to down. Each figure can be rotated through 90° ("Up" key) and also move horizontally ("Right" or "Left" key).  
You can also "dump" the figure (i.e., accelerate its fall), when the player has already decided where the figure should fall ("Down" key).  
The figure falls until it rests another figure or it will not hit the bottom of the glass.  
If at the same time a horizontal row of 10 cells is filled, then this series disappears, and the player receives a certain number of points.  
All the rows above the missing are dropped down one square. The game ends when a new figure can not fit in a play field.  
Thus, the player's task is to fill the ranks without filling the play field (vertically) as long as possible to get more points.  
The game has no time limits, it all depends only on the vertical filling of the field and the availability of space for new figures.  

Scoring:  
1 line - 100 points,  
2 lines - 300 points,  
3 lines - 700 points,  
4 lines (that is, make Tetris) - 1500 points.
